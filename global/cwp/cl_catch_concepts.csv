"FE",,"Fish encountering fishing gear","The live weight of all aquatic organisms which encounter the fishing gear that are either caught (or otherwise killed and lost), or escape alive"
"EL",,"Live escapement","The live weight of all aquatic organisms which encountered the fishing gear but escaped alive"
"GR",,"Gross removal","The live weight of all aquatic organisms caught, or killed, during a fishing operation, including individuals which are killed but may be lost and not caught"
"PCL",,"Pre-catch losses","The live weight of aquatic organisms which died as a result of the fishing operation and which are lost and not caught, including losses caused through gear lost during fishing, depredation, as well as entanglement with the fishing gear."
"GC",,"Gross catches","Total live weight of aquatic organisms caught (i.e., including retained catches and discards)"
"RC",,"Retained catch","Total live weight of aquatic organisms retained (either alive or dead)"
"RCD",,"Retained catch – dead","Total live weight of aquatic organisms retained, dead, which may be subsequently landed, processed or otherwise utilised"
"RCA",,"Retained catch – alive","Total live weight of aquatic organisms retained alive, for example for the purposes of fattening in aquaculture or are maintained alive for the market, as in the case of bluefin tuna"
"LDP",,"Losses due to dressing, handling and processing","Losses due to dumped viscera, heads and other parts, or loss of fluid content"
"GPL",,"Gains prior to landing","Gain of fluid content, or addition of liquids or solids during shipboard processing"
"ULL",,"Utilization and losses prior to landing","Quantities consumed by the crew, used for bait, spoilage and subsequent dumping, or losses during handling at sea or when landing"
"TL",,"Total landings","Total net weight (product weight) of the quantities landed, at the time of landing, which may include processed and unprocessed quantities"
"LWE",,"Live-weight equivalent conversion Factor","Conversion factor used to transform processed quantities to live weight equivalent (LWE)"
"NL",,"Nominal landings","Total landings (including quantities landed as transhipments) converted to live weight equivalent, also expressed in some national publications as: i) landings on a round, fresh basis; ii) landings on a round, whole basis; iii) landings on an ex-water weight basis"
"NC",,"Nominal catch","Nominal landings plus the component of the catch discarded dead, and post-release mortality of fish discarded alive. It approximates the concept of 'total catch' (i.e., the quantity of biomass removed)"
"D",,"Discarded catch","The total live weight of aquatic organisms discarded, either dead or alive"
"DD",,"Discarded dead","The total live weight of aquatic organisms discarded dead, including recorded and unrecorded discards, including catch rejected or dumped at sea due to, e.g., spoilage or retention bans. Recorded dead discards may be collected via logbooks, sampling of catches, onboard observers, electronic monitoring systems, or other forms of data recording"
"DL",,"Discarded alive","The total live weight of aquatic organisms discarded alive, including recorded and unrecorded discards alive. Recorded discards alive may be collected via logbooks, sampling of catches, onboard observers, electronic monitoring systems, or other forms of data recording"
"PRS",,"Post-release survival of discards alive","Post-release survival component of the catch that is discarded alive, for example estimated as the proportion or ratio of the biomass or number of individuals that survive after being released. Quantities are subsequently returned to the living resource environment alive and also the spawning biomass"
"PRM",,"Post-release mortality of discards alive","Post-release mortality component of the catch that is discarded alive, for example estimated as the proportion or ratio of the biomass or number of individuals that die after being released. The rate of mortality may vary by species, age, and also by gear. Quantities are subsequently recorded under the nominal catch due to the loss of biomass"
